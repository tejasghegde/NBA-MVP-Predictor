Welcome to the NBA most valuable player (MVP) prediction tutorial! In this notebook, you will learn how to scrape NBA data and preprocess it in order to train a neural network to predict the regular season MVP winner. You will interact with and learn about several prominent Python libraries, including Pandas, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. By the end of this tutorial, you will feel confident implementing a neural network in PyTorch and have a better understanding of the factors that contribute to an NBA player being crowned MVP of the league. This tutorial is meant to be challenging, so if you don't understand everything, don't worry. This is meant to be an introduction to machine learning and hopefully, a jumping off point to learn even more.
